# ROCK-DOS  Source Code
This repo contains the source-code and compiled binaries for all versions of ROCK-DOS.

These are modified from the same files [of MS-DOS originally shared at the Computer History Museum on March 25th, 2014]( http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/microsoft-ms-dos-early-source-code/) and are being (re)published in this repo to make them easier to find, reference-to in external writing and works, and to allow exploration and experimentation for those interested in early PC Operating Systems.
